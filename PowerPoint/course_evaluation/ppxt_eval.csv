Slide Number,Title,Slide Text,Notes Text,Response
1,No Title,,,"Positive aspect: The slide has a clean design with a clear title and subtitle, which is immediately noticeable and easy to read.

Feedback for improvement:

1. Text Contrast: Ensure there is sufficient contrast between the text and the background for better readability. The subtitle is slightly difficult to read against the background image.

2. Image Relevance: Consider if the image directly relates to the content. The image of a person may not directly convey the concept of ""AI for Workforce"" or ""Applied Ethics for AI.""

3. Information Hierarchy: Differentiate the text for 'Facilitator Training' and 'Applied Ethics for AI' to clarify that they are two different categories of information – possibly through bullet points or separate lines.

Remember to maintain professionalism in the slide's visual and textual elements to optimize clarity and viewer engagement."
2,Overview of Course Curriculum,,,"Good thing: The slide has a clear title and distinct sections separating the main points, which helps guide the viewer's understanding.

Three specific and actionable pieces of feedback:

1. Simplify Language: Replace the phrase ""also known as aretaic ethics"" with ""also called aretaic ethics"" for greater clarity and simplicity.

2. Increase Readability: The text overlay on the triangle graphic is difficult to read due to color contrast issues. Consider removing the text from the graphic or altering the graphic's opacity to improve readability.

3. Consistency: Ensure that bullet points consistently follow either a full-stop or no full-stop rule throughout the slide. There is an inconsistency in the use of periods at the end of bulleted sentences.

By addressing these points, the slide can be improved for better clarity, simplicity, and visual appeal."
3,Additional Resources,,,"Positive Feedback:
- The slide has a straightforward title that clearly indicates its purpose.

Areas for Improvement:
1. Text Contrast: Improve contrast between the text and the background to enhance readability, perhaps by using a lighter text color or a semi-opaque panel behind the text.
2. Font Size: Increase the size of the subtitle ""intel digital readiness"" to make it more legible, ensuring it's easily noticed and read by the audience.
3. Unrelated Imagery: Consider replacing the background image with one more directly related to the course content to better support the slide's message and not distract with unrelated complex formulas."
4,Week 1 – Introduction to AI Ethics,,,"The slide is effective in using a simple color scheme and layout that doesn't distract from the information being presented.

1. Good Point: The table format is good for organizing the various resources into an easy-to-scan list.

Feedback:

1. Clarity: Reduce jargon and technical language for accessibility; for example, ""Applied AI Ethics Example Index"" could be simplified to ""AI Ethics Examples.""

2. Simplicity: Ensure consistency in descriptions; some entries in the ""Description"" section are longer and more detailed than others, making them less pithy. Strive to use concise, direct language throughout.

3. Visual Appeal: Increase text contrast against the background for readability, particularly for the light blue text, and consider a larger font size for better legibility.

Overall, aim for uniformity in the level of detail and the presentation style in each entry to improve the slide's clarity and simplicity."
5,Agenda,"Agenda
Unintended Consequences of AI 
Bias in AI
Transparency in AI
Explainability in AI
Accountability in AI
","Week 3 and week 4 are very interconnected, as week 3 introduces core ideas in applied AI ethics like unintended consequences, dealing with bias, transparency, explainability, and accountability.However, in week 3 we are discussing examples, real or fictional, of bias influencing decision making in a negative way, examples of a lack in transparency, explainability, or accountability, and negataive unintended consequences.Then in week 4, we discuss them as core principles of applied AI ethics and how to uphold them.","As a PowerPoint slide evaluator, here is my feedback:

Good Aspect:
- The title of the session ""Week 1 – Introduction to AI Ethics"" is clear and specifies the content and timing of the session.

Feedback for Improvement:
1. Clarity & Simplicity: The background image contains complex formulas which could be distracting and might not directly relate to the concept of AI Ethics. Consider using an image that better represents AI or ethical concepts without unnecessary complexity.
2. Visual Appeal: The contrast between the text and the background is low, which might make the text difficult to read. Use a higher contrast color for the text or a darker overlay on the image to ensure readability.
3. Cohesion: The logo on the bottom left (""intel digital readiness"") appears disconnected from the topic of the slide. Make sure any branding is subtly integrated without drawing attention away from the main content.

6,Discussion,"What is the dilemma here?
What should Mike do in this situation?
What would you do if your work was compromised due to a flaw you were responsible for revealing?
Discussion
","The dilemma is:Deciding whether to delay the release, face financial losses, or allow the flawed product to be shipped risks damaging the company's reputation.","Good aspect of the slide:
- The slide is minimalistic and free of any unnecessary graphics or text, which makes it easy to read.

Areas for improvement:
1. Font Choice: Consider using a sans-serif font with a slightly larger size to enhance readability and modern appeal.
2. Color Contrast: Increase the contrast between the text and the background to make the points stand out more clearly.
3. Consistency: Ensure consistent alignment and positioning of the elements (logo, text) for a polished and professional look."
7,Key Terms for this Week,,,"The slide is clear and simple in its presentation of the discussion questions. They are direct and do not use extravagant phrasing.

Good thing about the slide: The text is concise and the questions are straightforward, making it easy for the audience to understand the prompts for discussion.

Feedback for improvement:
1. Provide a brief context or introduction to the discussion points to clarify the scenario or topic being addressed.
2. Use bullet points or numbering with more distinct formatting (e.g., bolder or different colored text) to make each question stand out.
3. Increase visual appeal by incorporating relevant icons or images next to each question to create a more engaging and memorable slide."
8,Ethics vs Morality – Ending the Confusion,,,"Based on the text provided in the slide:

Good Aspect:
- The slide uses visually distinct colors and shapes to differentiate and categorize concepts, which aids in distinguishing between the key terms related to ethics.

Feedback for Clarity and Simplicity:
1. Ensure consistent terminology across the slide to prevent confusion (e.g., ""Moralitas,"" ""Mórálitas,"" and ""Morality"" seem to refer to the same concept but are labeled differently).
2. Simplify language where possible and consider removing less common terms like ""Mórálitas"" or providing a brief explanation for such terms if they must be included.
3. Reduce the number of concepts per slide or group them more logically for better comprehension. The slide appears to mix general ethical concepts with AI-specific ones, which may overcomplicate the information flow.

Feedback for Visual Appeal:
1. Standardize font size and style throughout the slide for a more cohesive and professional look.
2. Align text consistently within the shapes for improved readability and aesthetics.
3. Avoid overcrowding by reducing the number of different elements on the slide, thus allowing each concept more space and making the slide less busy."
9,Ethics vs Morality,,,"Good Aspect:
The slide features a clean layout with a simple color scheme, which aids in maintaining focus on the content.

Areas for Improvement:
1. Clarity: Remove the first bullet's introductory clause ""For this course, it is important that we have a clear understanding,"" to go straight to the point: ""Define 'moral' and 'ethical' for clarity throughout the course.""
2. Simplicity: Consolidate the second and third bullet points to avoid redundancy, as they convey a similar message. For example, ""Ethics and morality definitions referenced will be as follows:"" and then lead into the diagram.
3. Visual Appeal: Increase contrast between text and background colors for enhanced readability, particularly in the diagram where blue text on a blue background may be difficult to read. Consider a darker font color or a lighter background within the diagram shapes.

Remember to maintain direct and concise language in revisions for optimal clarity and simplicity."
10,Normative Ethics ,,,"Good Thing About the Slide:
- The slide effectively uses a two-column format to clearly differentiate between the concepts of Ethics and Morality.

Feedback:
1. Font Size: Increase the font size for the headings ""Ethics"" and ""Morality"" to create a clearer visual hierarchy and enhance readability.
2. Text Alignment: Align the text in both columns to the top to maintain consistent vertical alignment, improving the slide's neatness and flow.
3. Bullet Point Consistency: Use parallel structure in the bullet points for clarity and readability, e.g., ""Ethics: field of study"" and ""Morality: guiding principles,"" to maintain a direct comparison.

Overall, the slide presents information in a straightforward manner, avoiding extravagant phrasing and aligning well with the directive for clarity and simplicity."
11,Mitigating Ethical Issues,,,"Positive Aspect:
- The slide has a clean layout with a clear title and section headings that differentiate the content sections effectively.

Feedback for Improvement:
1. Clarity: The explanation of virtue ethics could be simplified. Instead of ""also known as aretaic ethics,"" simply state ""Virtue ethics focuses on character and moral virtues.""
2. Simplicity: Remove redundant phrases to make the bullet points more concise, such as changing ""Virtue ethics is person-based and not action or rule-based"" to ""Virtue ethics values character over actions or rules.""
3. Visual Appeal: The image in the background is a good visual touch, but the text overlaid on the image (VIRTUE ETHICS) is not necessary and adds clutter. Removing it would enhance the simplicity and focus on the slide's core content."
12,Mitigating Ethical Issues,,,"Good: The slide uses clear headings and bullet-point structure that helps in understanding the hierarchy of information.

Feedback:
1. Clarify language: The phrase ""approaches needed to mitigate ethical issues in AI systems in a production environment"" could be simplified for clarity. Consider revising to ""Ways to Address Ethical Issues in AI Systems"".
2. Visual interest: Add icons or imagery related to each strategy for a more engaging visual appeal.
3. Consistent formatting: Ensure that bullet points (""We can categorize..."") align with the overall design and text consistency to maintain a professional look.
4. Color usage: Introduce another color or two to differentiate the types of strategies or to highlight key areas, without compromising the overall clean look of the slide."
,,,,"Good Thing:
- The slide makes good use of color coding to differentiate the key strategy areas, enhancing visual appeal.

Feedback for Clarity and Simplicity:
1. The phrase ""Preventive strategies in AI ethics involve measures taken in advance to avoid or minimize potential ethical issues"" may benefit from further simplification. Consider rephrasing to ""Preventive strategies in AI help avoid or reduce ethical risks beforehand.""
2. The term ""pre-emptively address potential ethical issues within an application before they occur or escalate beyond control"" is somewhat redundant as 'pre-emptively' and 'before they occur' convey the same timing. A clearer phrasing would be ""Preventive strategies address ethical issues in applications before they escalate.""

Feedback for Visual Appeal:
3. The text density in the bullet point sections could be reduced for better readability. Consider using bullet points for each of the listed strategies instead of a paragraph format.
4. To enhance visual appeal and focus, consider adding icons or simple graphics next to each strategy area (Continuous Monitoring and Evaluation, Feedback Loops, etc.) to create visual cues for the audience."
